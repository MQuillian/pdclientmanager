# PDClientManager

PDClientManager is a webapp for efficiently managing the clients and caseload of a public defender's office. By streamlining processes for creating and controlling the various records, PDClientManager seeks to enable those providing indigent legal services the support and tools necessary to achieve the optimal results for clients.

PDClientManager tracks and displays various metrics, such as aging reports, that often have to be calculated manually. Automating the calculation of this kind of essential information relieves the burden on office staff of managing this responsibility. This encourages continuous awareness of the overall health and functioning of the office, thereby shortening the time required to address any issues and improving outcomes for clients.
